# Frontend-Backend API Integration

## Task Objective
Connect the React frontend to the Python FastAPI backend for video summarization functionality.

## Current State
- Frontend is using mock data for video summaries and metadata
- Backend API has endpoints for YouTube video processing and file uploads
- No connection exists between the frontend and backend

## Future State
- Frontend will communicate with backend API to process videos
- Videos can be added via YouTube URL or direct file upload
- Job status is tracked and displayed to the user
- Summaries are retrieved from backend processing

## Implementation Plan

1. Create API service layer in frontend
   - [x] Create API client with endpoints mapping to backend
   - [x] Implement job polling mechanism for async operations
   - [x] Add error handling and retry logic

2. Update frontend components to use API
   - [x] Replace mock data functions with API calls
   - [x] Update AddVideoForm to support both YouTube URLs and file uploads
   - [x] Add progress indicators and loading states

3. Test integration
   - [ ] Start backend server
   - [ ] Test YouTube URL processing
   - [ ] Test file upload processing
   - [ ] Verify summary retrieval and display

4. Deployment considerations
   - [ ] Configure CORS properly for production
   - [ ] Set up environment variables for API URL configuration
   - [ ] Document API endpoints and response formats
