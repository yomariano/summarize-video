# Build Notes: Video Summarizer Initial Implementation

## Task Objective
Create a Python script to summarize videos using Gemma 3 multimodal model by extracting frames and transcribing audio.

## Current State
No implementation exists yet. Need to create a complete script that can process videos and generate summaries.

## Future State
A functional Python script that can:
1. Extract audio from videos and transcribe it using Whisper
2. Extract key frames from videos using FFmpeg
3. Feed transcriptions and frames to Gemma 3 for summarization
4. Output and save summaries

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up project structure
   - [x] Create directory structure
   - [x] Add `__init__.py` file
   - [x] Create requirements.txt

2. Implement core functionality
   - [x] Create utilities module
   - [x] Implement audio extraction and transcription
   - [x] Implement frame extraction
   - [x] Implement Gemma 3 integration

3. Add user interface
   - [x] Create command-line interface with argparse
   - [x] Add options for customization
   - [x] Add dependency checking

4. Create documentation
   - [x] Write comprehensive README
   - [x] Document code with docstrings
   - [x] Create build notes (this document)

## Updates

[2025-03-21] Initial implementation completed with the following components:
- src/utils.py: Utility functions for dependency checking and video processing
- src/summarize_video.py: Main script with command-line interface
- requirements.txt: Python dependencies
- README.md: Usage instructions

The current implementation uses "google/gemma-27b-multimodal" as a placeholder model name, which should be updated when Gemma 3 is officially released with its correct model identifier.

Next steps:
- [ ] Test with real videos
- [ ] Optimize frame selection algorithm
- [ ] Add support for longer videos by processing in chunks
- [ ] Consider adding a simple web interface
