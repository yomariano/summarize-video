# Video Summarizer Project Context

## Project Scope

This project aims to create a Python-based tool that can automatically generate summaries of video content by leveraging multimodal AI capabilities. The primary focus is on using Google's Gemma 3 multimodal model to analyze both visual and audio content from videos to produce concise, accurate summaries.

## Core Requirements

1. **Video Processing**
   - Extract audio from video files
   - Extract key frames at configurable intervals
   - Support common video formats (MP4, MOV, AVI, etc.)

2. **Audio Transcription**
   - Transcribe speech to text using OpenAI's Whisper model
   - Support multiple languages (based on Whisper capabilities)
   - Handle variable audio quality

3. **Multimodal Analysis**
   - Integrate with Gemma 3 multimodal model
   - Process both text transcriptions and visual frames
   - Generate coherent summaries based on combined analysis

4. **User Interface**
   - Provide an intuitive command-line interface
   - Support configuration of key parameters
   - Output summaries to console and text files

## Technical Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Optimize for speed while maintaining summary quality
   - Support processing on both CPU and GPU
   - Handle videos of varying lengths efficiently

2. **Modularity**
   - Separate video processing, transcription, and summarization components
   - Allow individual components to be updated or replaced
   - Maintain clean interfaces between modules

3. **Error Handling**
   - Provide clear error messages for common issues
   - Gracefully handle missing dependencies
   - Implement recovery mechanisms for processing interruptions

4. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
   - Clear code documentation with docstrings
   - Build notes tracking implementation progress

## Future Considerations

1. **Enhancements**
   - Scene detection for more intelligent frame selection
   - Summary customization options (length, style, focus)
   - Support for batch processing multiple videos

2. **User Experience**
   - Web-based interface for broader accessibility
   - Progress indicators for long-running operations
   - Preview functionality for extracted frames and transcriptions

3. **Integration**
   - API endpoint for service integration
   - Support for cloud storage sources and destinations
   - Integration with video hosting platforms
